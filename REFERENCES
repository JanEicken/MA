This library is intended to be helpful in research and contains a lot
of code from different sources integrated into an accessible library. 

Here is a (hopefully complete) list of contributing sources (and licenses):

1) bloom/murmur.hpp
	https://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/

	Encapsulates the implementation of the Murmurhash as found on 
	into a header-only library removing some cool features.
	
	However, some automatic template-driven selection of the 64bit and
	32 bit implementation are planned at least for the two most important
	compiler families GNU g++ and MSVC, see the comment in the file
2) samples/prague.dat
	http://trajectorycomputing.com/datasets/prague-ego-shooter-dataset/
	
	A very clean, small trajectory dataset generated from a modified 
	Urban Terror server running the map Prague.
