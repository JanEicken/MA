LIBTRAJCOMP 0.1
---------------

Welcome to the initial release of the Trajectory Computing Library 

	libtrajcomp

We intend to bring together clean, template-driven C++ implementation of 
important algorithms in the field of trajectory computing in order to
facilitate research in this domain. 

The choice of template-driven C++ is due to the importance of fast computing
and memory effectiveness unreachable with, for example, Java or pure python
and the list of bindings:

Currently, bindings for GNU octave and python are given, however, as time
goes on, we will add bindings for mobile operating systems, especially 
Android and the iPhone, which makes further clear, why we chose the most
portable language for these domains.

If you are interested in Java implementations, you can find some on our
Java trajectory computing sub-page, mainly contributed by students of mine:

If you can give useful comments or even contribute algorithms or patches,
send them to me via email (for the first time, we might turn to a platform
for that, once a community grows...)

Have fun with this and consider the examples given on

Thank you for downloading this distribution,
